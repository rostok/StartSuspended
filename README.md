# StartSuspended

A simple command line app that allows to run application and suspend it after defined delay (in order to tinker with it or inject DLL). Fact is this is just command line conversion based on a tool made by hofingerandi http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/230005/Launch-a-process-suspended

# Syntax

`StartSuspended.exe application.exe 250`
